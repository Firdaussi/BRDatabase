The outstanding news-item of June was the return of "Schools" 4-4-0s to the Western Section with the transfer of Nos. 30903-7, made redundant at St. Leonards by the Hastings diesels, to Nine Elms. Nos. 30904/7 were noted at Bournemouth on June 22, heading the 12.35 and 11.22 respectively from Waterloo, No. 30903 was on the 8.45 a.m. Waterloo-Lymington, and the same day No. 30906 travelled very unfamiliar track by running to Exeter with the 3.5 p.m. from Waterloo; the last-mentioned spent the week-end at Exmouth Junction and returned eastward with empty stock on the Monday, when No. 30905 was observed at Woking on the 3.54 p.m. Waterloo-Basingstoke and 7.40 p.m. back.

Feltham "S15" 4-6-0 No. 30505 travelled through to the West the following week-end and headed the 6.35 p.m. Exeter-Waterloo on June 24.

For the Bournemouth two-hour expresses modified "Merchant Navy" Pacifics 35021/6 have been added to the Bournemouth allocation (the latter was exchanged with Exmouth Junction for No. 35011), and engines of this type from Bournemouth and Nine Elms were all but monopolising the accelerated services in June. 
A light Pacific, No. 34109, was turned out by Bournemouth shed to work its hard turn covering the 7.7 a.m. Bournemouth West—Waterloo, the "Belle" both ways and the 9.30 p.m. Waterloo-Bournemouth Central on June 24.

An unusual engine to be employed as Parkstone banker on June 7 was "L1" 4-4-0 No. 31777 (75A), which had previously been on Bournemouth shed for several days for attention to its bearings ; owing to the heavy holiday traffic it was the only engine available for the job. 
At Eastleigh on June 22 light Pacific No. 34005 was being rebuilt ; on completion it was to be allocated to Stewarts Lane in place of No. 34090, also in works that day, which was destined for Nine Elms. No. 34005 ’s original tender is now believed to be on No. 34094. 
Five ex-W.D. Stanier 2-8-Os were expected in Eastleigh works, evidently to be reconditioned for return to B.R., and the first to arrive were Nos. 501/12 of the Longmoor Military Railway; there seems to have been some uncertainty as to their B.R. numbers, as No. 501 was first painted 90743, then repainted 90734 and is now 48774. 
For the first time for several years, a "P" 0-6-0 tank, No. 31325 (75A), was operating on the Hayling Island branch on June 12 ; later in the month it was shunting at Winchester instead of the usual "B4" 0-4-0 tank.
