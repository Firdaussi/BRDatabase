London Midland Region An unprecedented sight at Derby on October 9 was Class A4 4-6-2 No. 60021 Wild Swan of New England, which arrived heading the 12.15 p.m. Newcastle-Bristol train. The A4 came off the train here and the following morning worked the 6.30 a.m. stopping train from Derby to Shefiield Midland. A week later on October 16 another E.R. Pacitic, Class Al No. 60146 Pere- grine, arrived light at Derby in company with "Austerity" 2-8-0 No. 90260, both retiring to the shed. A correspondent reports that both A4s and L.M. 8P 4-6-2s are now permitted to run over the Midland route from Chesterfield to Barnt Green with a few local restrictions. Contrary to previous expectations, the latest batch of B.R./Sulzer Type 2 diesels for the Midland, Nos. D7568 onwards, has not been restyled externally; it has the same front-end design as the earlier D51XX series, including gangway connections, which have been abandoned on most other types originally so iitted. These Type 2s are now covering a high proportion of the lower category freight work on the Midland main line south of Wellingborough. Leicester now has on its allocation 12 of the 1,250 h.p. B.R./Sulzer Type 2s with G.E.C. electrical equipment, numbered from D5233. Two of these locomotives are at March and Saltley for driver training. The N.E.R. is leaning six diesel multiple- units for the Derby—Nottingham—Birmingham service to cover a shortage of L.M.R. units, some of which are believed to be in poor condition. The 11 four-wheel A.C.V. and B.U.T. light- weight railcars, used for most of their short life on the Watford—St. Albans and Harrow- Belmont branches, and which have been out of service for the last two years, have at last been oiiicially condemned; four, at least, of the ears,  arrived at Derby in September. On October 21 ‘“Britannia" Pacific N0. 70012 was unusually em- ployed on the 5.2 p.m. Nottingham Midland— Derby stopping train. B.R./Sulzer Type 4 diesel No. D52 has been named Lancashire Fusi/fer. With the winter service the remaining Wolver- hampton—Euston services now start from Bir- mingham New Street. The empty stock for the 5 p.m. starts from Kings Norton and the train leaves from the Midland side: a curious feature on Saturdays is that the empty stock is worked by a Bushbury crew who are relieved at New Street and travel home passenger. An earlier report that Crewe works was painting all except ex- press locomotives black was evidently incorrect, for on October 22 Class 2 2-6-0 No. 46509 was in the paint shop freshly painted in green. Elsewhere in the works frames had been laid for Brush Type 4 Co-Cos up to D1569 (ree also page 367). On September 28 a Hymek Type 3, No. D7022, worked a l4—coach football excursion throughout from Swindon to Northampton via Oxford and Bletchley. The last surviving G.E. B12 4-6-0, although officially withdrawn two years ago but still in working order pending a decision on preservation, was used for an excursion on October 5 from Broad Street on an itinerary taking in Hitchin, Northampton, Stratford-on- Avon, Warwick and Rugby. As the E.R. now has no facilities for the preparation of steam loco- motives in London, No. 61572 had to be hauled dead to Willesden for servicing. Birmingham R.C.W. Co. 1,250 h.p. Type 2 diesels from Saltley were working Birmingham—Whitemoor freights by the beginning of November. While the G.C. line still sees a profusion of steam power, Cricklewood occasionally turns out a B.R.fSulzer type 2 on local workings. On October 14 and 15. however. Type 4s Nos. D79 and D45 respectively powered the 2.25 p.m. Marylebone- Aylesbury parcels, which, since it runs via High  Wycombe, may have introduced a new type to the Princes Risborough—Aylesbury branch. On both days the locomotives acted as Aylesbury station pilot before returning home light via Amersham. A derailment on the G.C. main line between Gotham and East Leake on October 3 provided a number of interesting diversions. Most trains were re-routed through Derby (Friargate) and Burton-on-Trent, but two trains, the 3.30 p.m. Hull to Plymouth fish headed by E.E. Type 3 No. D6735 and the 4.30 p.m. Grimsby—Whitland fish with 9F 2-10-0 No. 92148, travelled over the former G.N.-L.N.W. joint line through Melton Mowbray to Market Harborough then via Northampton Bridge Street, Blisworth, Bletchley and Oxford to gain the W.R. The 8.45 p.m. Marylebone to York parcels, with Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 No. 45450 in charge, was diverted via Neasden, Brent and the Midland main line through Nottingham to Sheflield. This must have entailed propelling the train from Neasden South Junction ~~over the spur to Neasden Junction on the Midland Acton Wells Junction—Brent line, if the same -engine worked the train throughout. Darnall Brush Type 4 No. D1545 worked as far as Rugby Central on October 24 with the Newcastle—Bourne- mouth train, returning with the same day’s northbound train. Trials and crew training with Metrovick Type 2 Co-Bos on the I.C.I. trains from Tunstead to Northwich have continued; as .a result of the previous trials, a slight modification has been made to the locomotives’ brake proportional triple valves for this work. A Bulleid Pacific broke new ground when the ~·Giesl ejector-fitted No. 34064 Fighter Command took a Talyllyn Railway Society special as far as Ruabon on September 28. The trip was not without incident, however, for No. 34064 stalled -0n the sharp curve approaching Shrewsbury from the south and was assisted into the station by L.M. 2-6-2T No. 41209. On the return journey in the early hours of the following morning the Pacific was again in trouble when it slipped to a stand about eight miles south of Shrewsbury on the climb to Wellington. After about 20min it was able to restart the train without assistance. A °"C0r0nation" Pacific, No. 46245 City of London, worked a party special from Birmingham Snow Hill to Crewe works on September 28; the train travelled outwards via Market Drayton and returned via Shrewsbury. Earlier in the month on September 15, traffic between Birmingham Snow Hill and Wolverhampton was diverted via Old Hill and Dudley because of engineering works; this route includes some stretches of 1 in 41-70 which the "Western" class diesel locomotives on the Paddingt0n—Wolverhampton and Birkenhead »expresses—one at least of 14 vehicles——tackled unassisted. Last month we referred briefly to thethrough- out working of Class A1 4-6-2 No. 60114 W. P. Allen from Lincoln to Blackpool on September 28. In amplifying our report a correspondent points »out that the train travelled through Rochdale, Bury Knowsley Street and Bolton, a line over which nothing larger than a "Jubilee" 4-6-0 is normally permitted. The L.M.R. booked an assis- tant engine between Bolton and Rochdale for the return journey, but the Al managed the 10-coach train without help. At least two W.R. double- »chimney 9F 2-10-Os Nos. 92233/49 (86B) are working from Newton Heath and a further two members of the class Nos. 92008/79 (the latter the Lickey banker) are said to be allocated there. An apparent shortage of motive power in the Mirfield and Wakefield areas has brought a xnumber of spare engines, particularly B1 4-6-0s,  from other depots to the L.M. Central lines. The Bls have been regularly used from Mirfield depot on coal trains over the Pennines. [For L.M.R. information we are indebted to Messrs. H. Jayes, N. E. Gell, H. Gillot, P. Ward, P. Foster, W. A.

Five of its allocation, Nos. 60006/7/ 10/26/34, have been sent to Scotland and the remainder, 60017/21/5/9/32 condemned. The only remaining Pacifics in the E.R. are nine Als at Doncaster and six A3s at New England. Before this, however, reports continued to reach us of steam power in use at the southern end of the Great Northern main line. The second week of October saw an average of tive workings a day with peaks of nine steam workings on both October 8 and 10. Class Al, A3 and A4 4-6-2s predominated, but an occasional B1 4-6-0 and 9F 2-10-0 also found their way into town. On October 17, two A4s, Nos. 60017/21, were on Hornsey shed together, having worked in on freight; No. 60021, which a week earlier had penetrated L.M. territory as far as Derby (see L.M. notes), later took out the 4.20 p.m. from Kings Cross to Leeds and Bradford. An L.M. Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 No. 45224 (16F) even found its way on to the G.N. line with a freight seen passing Hitchin on the morning of October 8. The prototype 2,800 h.p. Brush "Falcon" locomotive is being re-equipped with new engines, following which it is to be loaned to the E.R. Meanwhile the A.E.I.-Birmingham/Sulzer proto- type, No. D0260 Lion, which as reported last month has been working between Kings Cross and Leeds, was in Doncaster works on October 11. Other visitors to the works have included B.R./ Sulzer Type 2s from the L.M.R., No. D5014 (1F) and D5019 (1B). The last steam locomotive to be overhauled at Doncaster was Class A4 4-6-2 No. 60009, which was outshopped in the first week of November. A previous report that all the "Baby Deltic" Type 2 diesels were to retain engines of their original type was in error; we now learn that No. D5901 is being equipped with a new pattern of English Electric four-stroke engine. The sight of former W.R. steam locomotives being hauled "dead" into G.E. territory may become more frequent at least for a time, as it is reported that a Norwich contractor expects to receive about 30 locomotives for breaking up. The latest procession, which as before ran via Bletchley and Oxford, set out on October 16 from Didcot with "County" class 4-6-0s Nos. 1007/18, 6lXX class 2-6-2T No. 6109, 57XX 0-6-0PT No. 5746 and 43XX 2-6-0 No. 7324. At Bicester No. 5746 was detached from the cavalcade with a hot axlebox, to continue its journey the following day in a normal freight train. Most of March’s "Britannia" allocation are in store; steam opera- tion from this depot—the last on the G.E.l1ne— is due to conclude at the end of November. [For E.R. information we are indebted to Messrs. R. J. Adderson, P. Large, G. J. Jennings, W. H. Pettit, M. Butler, P. A. Kentish. G. Cornell, R. James, J. Dale, P. Depledge, K. Lander, B. N. Humphris, N. K. Wilkin- son, J. Wolfe, R. Foster, C. D. Edwards and N. G. Cross.]  North Eastern Region The last two ofthe N.E.R.’s unnamed "Deltics" have now received names—No. D90l4 The Duke af Wellingmrfs Regiment and No. D90l7 The Durham Light Infantry. Correspondents report the first withdrawals of B.R. standard class 2 2-6-0s; Nos. 78011/2/5/24 have arrived at Darlington works for cutting up. Station pilot duties at Newcastle Central have been taken over by 204 h.p. diesel shunters, which have replaced the two Class J 72 0-6-0Ts in N.E.R. livery, Nos. 68723/36; these have been condemned. The latter were the last of the original J72s, although some of the B.R.-built batch survive. A "Royal Scot" 4-6-0 was recorded at Durham on October .22 when No. 46110 Gnmnudier Guardsman arrimd with the 3.9 p.m. Liverpool Lime Street·Newcastle. The summer activity by English Electric Type 3s on Hull—Brough trains was evidently a prelude to the winter service, for the remaining steam- hauled trains (with the exception of the workmen’s trains which are still hauled {by Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0s) have been taken over by Dairycoates Type 3s. On October 15 Class A4 No. 60010 deputised for a Type 4 diesel on the 3.34 a.m. York—Hull, then worked the 6.25 a.m. Hull- Gascoigne Wood mineral empties. Although "Britannia" Paciflcs frequently work into Mirfield from the Stockport direction, they  are rare at the Lancashire end of the Calder Valley main line. On October 25, however, No. 70050 Firth of Clyde made a circuitous journey over this route with emgty stock from Tyseley to Laisterdyke. No. 7005 later returned towards Mirtield over the Cleckheaton branch. [For N.E.R. information we are indebted to Messrs. R. J. Hebden, I. Smith, G. S. Knox, G. W. Stewart, D. R. Hall, K. R. McCall, W. Clement, M. Dale, J. A. Topham, B. Foster, B. M. Ashbury, J. Rogers, G. McLean, S. M. Hardy, A. Peel and M. C. Mellett.] Western Region The accelerated South Wales—London service with "Western" class locomotives appears to have made a good start, but, by the second week in October was showing signs of difficulties cansml by a shortage of locomotives of this class- On October 12, the up "Red Dragon" passed Reading about 15min late behind Hymek Type 3 No. D7078 and three days later was powered by D7086, which had also lost time. No fewer than 35 "Western" class units were reported out of action on October 30. Strangers reported at Reading include "Crab" 2-6-0 No. 42858 (8H) with an empty wagon train from Reading to Banbury on October 2 and a Shrewsbury Stanier Class 5 4-6-0, No. 45298. A crop of horsebox specials from the L.M.R. to the S.R. brought in Stanier Class 5 4-6-Os Nos. 45331 (IE) and 45379(5A) on October 8 and 12  I I \} respectively and "Jubilee" 4-6-0 No. 45685 (82E) on October 9. On October 6 another "Jubilee", No. 45552 worked a special from Paddington and a week later the restored L.S.W. T9 4-4-0, piloting a Class U 2-6-0, headed an en- thusiasts’ excursion through Reading to Banbury and Woodford. On October 19 the publisher of this journal sponsored a Pullman excursion from Paddington to Ilfracombe which was routed over the branch from Patney to Holt Junction and Bathampton. The restored A3 Pacific No. 4472 Flying Scotsman headed the train as far as Taunton, after which it ran light to Exeter Central to take over the train for the return trip to Waterloo. The W.R are planning to equip the platform ends at Paddington with electric cables which can be connected to the steam generating plants of the North British Type 2 Diesel-hydraulic locomotives. This will allow the boilers to function without the engines running, but the locomotives will need some modification before this can take place. A second unit of this class, No. D6327, has reached the London area. The first of the W.R. allocation of Brush 2,750 h.p. Type 4s, Nos. D1682/3, have arrived at Old Oak Common for crew training. The first reported passenger working of a South Wales E.E. Type 3 occurred on October 12  when No. D6856 headed the 11.15 a.m. excursion from Swansea to Cardiff in connection with the Wales v England international football match. Margam diesel depot is expected to be commis- sioned on December 21. Exmouth Junction soon made use of its newly acquired B.R. standard Class 5 4-6-0s on the former S.R. route to Plymouth. No. 73030 was at Laira on October 13 and No. 73166 worked through Tavistock on October 19 with a down morning freight, returning on the 4.52 p.m. from Plymouth to Exeter. No. 73161 meanwhile, was noted in use between Salisbury and Exeter on a number of occasions. B.R. standard 2-6-4Ts are also working over the former S.R. line; No. 80067 was on a freight at Devonport on October 14 and others have been reported on Meldon Quarry trains and on stopping trains from Exeter Central to Honiton. Nevertheless, S.R. Class N 2-6—0s have not been completely displaced from duties on the Plymouth line. W.R. Cross-Country diesel m.u. sets are now working the 7.30 a.m. from Plymouth to Exeter Central via Okehampton and the return trip at 11.55 a.m. These units also have three return  trips from Exeter Central to Ilfracombe and a Sunday evening working from Exeter to Honiton and back. A W.R. 0-6-0. No. 2214, fitted with a snowplough, made a test run from Exeter to Okehampton on October 16, the first visit of this class to the former S.R. route. A Stanier 2-8-0, No. 48423 (SH), headed west through Exeter St. Davids with a special freight on September 27 and on the following day another engine of the same class, No. 48120 (IF), passed through St. Davids with a freight for Severn Tunnel Junction. B.R./Sulzer Type 4 No. D34 also reached as far west as Newton Abbot on October 4, working the 5.30 a.m. Paddington—Plymouth. The Class W 2-6-4Ts have largely been displaced from banking duties between Exeter St. Davids and Exeter Central by former G.W.R. 0-6-0PTs, assisted at times by former L.M.S. Class 2 2-6-2Ts, and B.R. Class 3 2-6-2Ts and Class 4 2-6-4Ts. On October ll one of the Meldon Quarry ballast trains was seen between St. Davids and Central powered by four engines, each of a different class—a B.R. 2-6-4T as train engine, piloted by an L.M. 2-6-2T with a W 2-6-4T and 0-6-0PT at the rear. A G.W. pannier tank, No. 3759, put in an appearance on the Tipton St. .lohns—Exmouth line on October 7, working the 5.50 p.m. from Exmouth and the 6.39 p.m. back. This branch, together with the Sidmouth,  Seaton and Lyme Regis branches are likely to be taken over soon by single-unit diesel railcars displaced from other parts of the W.R. The closure of the Exe Valley branch on October 5 brought a completely dieselised service to the line. The authorities provided N.B.L. Type 2 diesels Nos. D6327/43/8 and sets of Eve or six coaches. Hymek Type 3 diesel No. D7056 is at Laira for engine changing and not crew training, as reported last month. Two "West Country" Pacifics found their way to Westbury during the night of October 19/20. Because of engineering works at Tisbury the 11.38 p.m. Waterloo—Torrington return excursion was diverted from Salisbury via Westbury, Castle Cary and over the wartime connection between the Castle Cary—Weymouth and Yeovil Town- Yeovil Junction lines. The first engine headed the train as far as Westbury, where No. 34109 took over forutlge journeypn to Exeter. Southern Region The appearances of W.R. Hymek Type 3s on the Reading—Redhill line are becoming more frequent. On Saturdays at least, a unit from Bath Road appears to have a regular working, taking in the 6.50 a.m. from Reading to Redhill and the 11.35 a.m. from Redhill to Reading; so far D7070/12 have been seen on this duty on October 5 and 12 respectively. Exmouth Junction Pacifics now have a regular duty within the Central Division. Now that one of these covers the Plymouth—Brighton through train each way, it is employed on a till-in duty during its stay at Brighton, which comprises the 9.32 p.m. Brighton-Norwood freight and 5.32 a.m. London Bridge-Brighton vans; on Saturdays, instead of the 5.32, it takes the 3.27 a.m. to Eastbourne, then runs light to Brighton. On Sundays the Exmouth Junction Pacific heads the 10.0 a.m. Brighton—Bournemouth West and 7.32 p.m. back. Steam working to Brighton is expected to cease in January. The Brighton—Ply- mouth train is likely to be electrically-hauled from Brighton, diverted into Portsmouth, and steam or diesel-hauled from that point onwards. Trials of electro-diesel locomotives on mixed formations of electric stock continue. On October 1 E6002/6 were seen hauling three coaches of 4-CEP unit 7l47 and two complete 4-CEPs Nos. 72l4 and 7200 with motor luggage van S68003 bringing up the rear. Previous trials of this nature have been conducted to assess the problems likely to arise in working high speed push-and-pull trains. [For S.R. information we are indebted to Messrs. T. Phillips, R. Price, R. F. W. Saton, A. Langley, J. Fuller, R. 1-I. Gardner, B. G. Boddy, R. Riddell, G. L. Hooper, J. I. Clarke and T. White.] Scottish Region The Ferryhill Pacific stud has changed once again since the beginning of the winter timetable and A2s Nos. 60524/7 have been transferred to Polmadie. In return, Ferryhill has received A4s Nos. 60012 from Dalry Road and 60010 from New England, the latter one of tive A4s trans- ferred from the Eastern to the Scottish Region. Ferryhill’s allocation now comprises A4s Nos. 60004/10/l/2 and A3 No. 60042, which together with A4 N0. 60031 of St. Rollox have been regular performers on services from Aberdeen to the south. But the Pacitics are occasionally in —short supply. On September 28 the 8.25 a.m. 3hr train from Glasgow to Aberdeen was in the hands of a Class 5 4-6·0, while the 5.17 a.m. up from Aberdeen had V2 2-6-2 No. 60835 on October 5 and A3 No. 60052—a recent arrival at St. Mar- garets from Gateshead—on October 16. On October 12, No. 60012 worked the southbound Postal from Aberdeen but did not return as booked and Carstairs turned out Kingmoor "Clan" Pacific No. 72009, which worked the up Postal on October 14. The following day, Kingmoor "‘Royal Scot" No. 46157 was on this duty. Another Crewe English Electric Type 4, No. D323, reached Aberdeen at the end of October and had charge of the 5.15 p.m. from Aberdeen to Glasgow on October 26. Two days later St. Rollox sent out Caprotti-fitted Class 5 4-6-0 No. 73146 on mts duty covering the 8.25 a.m. Glasgow-Aberdeen and the 5.15 p.m. back. At this time Class A4 No. 60010 was Ferryhill’s only Pacitic that had not been stopped from one cause or another. lt seems likely that when Ferryhill’s remaining A4, No. 60009 the last engine to be overhauled at Doncaster, returns, the A3 willvbe transferred away. English Electric Type 4 diesels of York  depot have been working through to Dundee on block cement trains. In the Bonnybridge area, N.B.L. Type 2s are employed mostly on freight duties but one occasionally appears on a Stirling—Edinburgh (Princes Street) working.The increasing coal trali c is handled by a variety of motive power ranging from J37 0-6-Os to diesels of 2,000—2,500 h.p. A B.R./Sulzer Type 4, which would otherwise be stranded at St. Rollox for the week-end after arrival with a freight at Sighthill, continues to work the 4.25 p.m. Glasg0w—lnverness train on Saturdays. This presumably forms the first leg of a fill—in turn covering the 4.25 p.m. Inverness- Euston train southwards from Perth mentioned last month. A correspondent corrects our inference in the October issue that a Stirling—London "Car· Sleeper" takes the New Cumnock route to Car- lisle. He points out that the Glasgow—Eastbourne car sleeper runs from St. Enoch to Carlisle via Kilmarnock and Dumfries. It is the Stirling— Sutton Coldfield (not London) car sleeper that takes the normal route via Carstairs and Beattock to Carlisle. Ardrossan shed has become one of the last outposts of former Caledonian 0-6-0s with Nos. 57309/36, 57566/90 and 57627 in use on local freights until recently. Nos. 57270, 57581 and 57630 were then transferred to Ardrossan as replacements. but on October 9, L.M. Class 2 2-6-0 No. 46498 arrived at the depot to take up duty.
